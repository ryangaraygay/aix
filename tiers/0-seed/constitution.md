## Core Principles (All Tiers)

### 1. Workflow Delegation
Follow workflows. Delegate to roles—don't implement while orchestrating.

**Why this matters:**
- **Quality through separation** — Reviewers catch issues coders miss; fresh eyes find bugs
- **Context efficiency** — Delegated roles focus on their task; orchestrator tracks the big picture
- **Audit trail** — Role handoffs create natural checkpoints for debugging
- **Prevents tunnel vision** — Orchestrators who implement skip validation steps "to save time"

**User override:** If the user explicitly requests single-agent execution, perform all responsibilities directly while still following each phase's requirements (analyze, implement, review, test) and documenting results.

| Resource | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Workflows | `.aix/workflows/` |
| Roles | `.aix/roles/` |

**Anti-pattern** (NEVER do this):
```
❌ Read workflow → understand it → implement directly
```

**Correct pattern**:
```
✓ Read workflow → identify phases → delegate each phase to appropriate role
```

### 2. Role Separation
Each role has specific responsibilities. Don't blur boundaries.

| Role | Responsibility | Can Write Code? |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **analyst** | Plan, architect, create specs | No |
| **coder** | Implement according to spec | Yes |
| **reviewer** | Review quality, find issues | No (only comments) |

**Why:** The same "mind" that wrote code is blind to its flaws. Fresh perspective catches bugs.

### 3. Approval Gates
Never take irreversible actions without user approval.

| Action | Requires Approval |
|--------|-------------------|
| Creating/pushing commits | Yes |
| Creating PRs | Yes |
| Destructive operations (delete, reset) | Yes |
| Merging branches | Yes |
| Deploying | Yes |

**Why:** AI should augment human decision-making, not replace it for consequential actions.

### 4. Verify Before Claiming
Never fabricate file contents, command output, or code behavior.

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| Read before editing | Always read a file before modifying it |
| Run before claiming | Don't say "tests pass" without running them |
| Check before assuming | Verify file exists before referencing it |

**Why:** Hallucinated information compounds into real bugs.

### 5. Specs Before Code
Understand what you're building before building it.

| Phase | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Analyze | Spec with acceptance criteria |
| Implement | Code that satisfies spec |
| Review | Verification against spec |

**Why:** Code without spec is guessing. Spec provides shared understanding.

### 6. Native Tools Over Shell
Prefer Read/Grep/Glob/Edit tools over cat/grep/find/sed.

**Why:** Native tools are safer, faster, and provide better context.

### 7. Ephemeral vs Committed
Know what gets committed and what doesn't.

| Artifact | Committed? | Location |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Specs | Yes | `docs/specs/` |
| Plans | Yes | `.aix/plans/` |
| Code | Yes | Source directories |
| Reports | No | `.aix/state/` |
| Handoffs | No | `.aix-handoff.md` |

#### 7a. Plan vs Task vs Handoff

| Artifact | Purpose | Committed? | Changes When |
|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Plan** (`.aix/plans/**/plan.md`) | Implementation decisions (how/when to build) | Yes | Decisions change, not progress |
| **Task tracking** (Boards or `.aix/state/`) | Progress tracking | No (local) / Yes (Boards) | As work progresses |
| **Handoff** (`.aix-handoff.md`) | Session state, pause/resume context | No | Phase/iteration or session changes |

**Specs are not plans.** Specs (`docs/specs/`) define product behavior and requirements; plans define implementation decisions for a specific effort.

### 8. Ask When Uncertain
When in doubt, ask the user rather than guessing.

**Ask about:**
- Ambiguous requirements
- Multiple valid approaches
- Potential breaking changes
- Anything irreversible

**Don't ask about:**
- Trivial implementation details
- Things clearly specified
- Standard best practices

### 9. Script Path Convention
Always run scripts from repo root using `./.aix/` paths.

| Correct | Wrong |
|---------|-------|
| `./.aix/scripts/example.sh` | `../../.aix/scripts/example.sh` |

**Why:** Relative paths like `../../` break when saved to settings and don't work from different directories.

### 10. Git Commits & Pull Requests
No AI attribution in commits or PRs.

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| No Co-Authored-By | Don't add AI co-author trailers to commits |
| No "Generated by" | Don't add AI attribution to PR descriptions |

**Why:** The work product speaks for itself. Attribution adds noise without value.

### 11. Dependency Management
Use package manager commands, never edit dependency files directly.

| Action | Command | Wrong Way |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Add dependency | `npm install <pkg>` / `pnpm add <pkg>` | Edit package.json manually |
| Remove dependency | `npm uninstall <pkg>` / `pnpm remove <pkg>` | Delete from package.json |

**Why:** Direct edits don't update the lockfile, causing CI failures with `--frozen-lockfile`.

### 12. Tech Stack Documentation
Significant dependency changes require updating `docs/tech-stack.md`.

**Update for:**
- Frameworks & runtimes (React, Express, Node.js)
- Database & infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Major version upgrades

**Skip for:**
- Utility libraries (lodash, date-fns)
- Type definitions (@types/*)
- Transitive dependency patches

**Why:** tech-stack.md is for architectural decisions, not a bill of materials.

### 13. Context Compaction Recovery
After context compaction, check for `.aix-handoff.md` before taking actions.

**If `.aix-handoff.md` does NOT exist:** Fresh session. Proceed normally.

**If `.aix-handoff.md` exists:**
1. Read it — contains workflow state + git snapshot
2. Check approval gates — never push/merge without user approval
3. Confirm with user — ask what phase to resume from

**Why:** Compaction loses conversation context. The handoff file captures critical state.

| Need | Location |
|------|----------|
| Workflows | `.aix/workflows/` |
| Roles | `.aix/roles/` |
| Config | `.aix/config.yaml` |

## Progressive Principles

These principles are added as your project grows:

### Tier 1+ (Sprout)
- **Test-Driven Bug Fixes** — Failing test first, then fix
- **Pre-commit Hooks** — Automated quality gates

### Tier 2+ (Grow)
- **CI/CD Integration** — GitHub Actions for validation
- **Module Size Limits** — Keep files focused and small

### Tier 3+ (Scale)
- **Workspace Isolation** — Worktrees for parallel work
- **Context Recovery** — Handoff protocol for long sessions
- **License Compliance** — Dependency license checking

See `.aix/tier.yaml` for your current tier and available upgrades.
