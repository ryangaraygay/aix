# AIX Capabilities Test Status

Track which capabilities have been verified working in CI.

## Core Framework

| Capability | Status | Verification | Notes |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Role delegation (Task tool) | Partial | Run 21217364686 | Delegation works, but models not verified |
| Model selection (opus/sonnet) | Untested | - | Need to verify logs show correct models |
| Workflow execution | Partial | Run 21217364686 | Standard workflow ran |

## Skills

| Skill | Status | Verification | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| agent-browser | Untested | - | Skill read but commands not executed in last run |
| aix-init | N/A | Local only | Bootstrap/upgrade work locally |
| adopt | Tested | Local | Used to adopt agent-browser |

## Hooks

| Hook | Status | Verification | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|-------|
| PreCompact | Untested | - | Needs long session to trigger |
| SessionStart (compact) | Untested | - | Needs compaction event |

## CI/Workflows

| Workflow | Status | Verification | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| aix-implement.yml | Working | Run 21217364686 | Fixed paths and claude_args |
| aix-plan.yml | Untested | - | Not triggered yet |

## Deferred Decisions

| Decision | Reason | Revisit When |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Orchestrator model (opus vs sonnet) | Sonnet default may be good enough for automated CI | Run into quality/capability issues |
| Subagent model selection via role files | Unknown if `model:` in frontmatter is respected | After test run shows logs |
| Hooks/compaction testing | Needs long-running session | Natural occurrence during heavy work |

**Note**: Can set orchestrator to opus via `--model claude-opus-4-5-20251101` in claude_args if needed.

## Next Test Plan

**Goal**: Verify models + agent-browser screenshot in single test

**Feature spec**:
```json
{
  "name": "verify-models-screenshot",
  "description": "Verify correct models for subagents and agent-browser screenshot capture",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Analyst subagent uses opus model",
    "Coder subagent uses sonnet model",
    "Reviewer subagent uses opus model",
    "Screenshot file committed to repo (not gitignored)",
    "agent-browser commands executed (not just skill read)"
  ],
  "complexity": "simple"
}
```

**Key changes needed**:
1. Explicit instruction to EXECUTE agent-browser commands
2. Explicit instruction to COMMIT screenshot file
3. Check logs for model names in subagent calls
